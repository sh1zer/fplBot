## Key Discoveries

### üéØ Major Findings:
1. **The `fixtures/` endpoint supports powerful filtering:**
   - `?event=X` - Returns fixtures for specific gameweek (10 per GW)
   - `?team=X` - Returns all fixtures for a specific team (38 total)

2. **The `events/` endpoint exists and works!** (Not in original docs)
   - Returns array of all 38 gameweeks with detailed statistics

3. **Most query parameters are ignored** - API returns full datasets regardless
   - `?limit`, `?page`, `?fields`, etc. are accepted but don't filter results
   - Exception: `fixtures/` endpoint respects `event` and `team` parameters

4. **All endpoints return JSON only** - `?format=xml` returns 404

5. **No authentication required** for most endpoints (including some documented as "auth required")

## Authentication

**Surprising Discovery:** Most endpoints that were documented as requiring authentication actually work without it:

- ‚úÖ `my-team/{manager_id}/` - Works without auth
- ‚úÖ `entry/{manager_id}/transfers-latest/` - Works without auth  
- ‚úÖ `me/` - Works without auth

This suggests the API may have relaxed authentication requirements or these endpoints return public data when accessed without auth.

## Team IDs Reference

Based on the API responses, team IDs 1-20 correspond to Premier League teams. The exact mapping would need to be determined from the `/bootstrap-static/` endpoint's `teams` array.

## Rate Limiting

No specific rate limits were encountered during testing, but it's recommended to implement reasonable delays between requests to avoid potential throttling.

## Next Steps for Integration

1. **Prioritize `fixtures/` endpoint filtering** - This provides the most useful parameter functionality
2. **Use `events/` endpoint** for gameweek metadata (this was not in original docs!)
3. **Implement `bootstrap-static/` caching** - Large response that changes infrequently
4. **Focus on team-specific queries** using `?team={id}` parameter
