## Usage Examples

### Get all gameweek data
```bash
curl "https://fantasy.premierleague.com/api/events/"
```

### Find current gameweek (in code)
```javascript
// Filter for is_current: true
const currentGameweek = events.find(event => event.is_current);
```

### Get gameweek statistics
```javascript
// Average score across all gameweeks
const avgScores = events.map(event => ({
  gameweek: event.id,
  avgScore: event.average_entry_score,
  highestScore: event.highest_score
}));
```

## Key Use Cases

1. **Current Gameweek Detection**: Use `is_current: true` to find active gameweek
2. **Deadline Tracking**: Monitor `deadline_time` for transfer deadlines  
3. **Statistics Analysis**: Track average scores, top performers
4. **Chip Usage Analytics**: See which chips are being played when
5. **Player Popularity**: Track most selected, captained, transferred players

## Integration Notes

1. **Gameweek Status**: Use boolean flags (`is_current`, `is_next`, `is_previous`) for navigation
2. **Player References**: Use player IDs with `/element-summary/{id}/` for player details
3. **Manager References**: Use `highest_scoring_entry` with `/entry/{id}/` for manager details
4. **Chip Strategy**: Analyze `chip_plays` array for chip usage patterns

- `/bootstrap-static/` - Get player names for IDs referenced here
- `/element-summary/{id}/` - Get details for top players
- `/entry/{id}/` - Get details for top managers  
- `/event/{id}/live/` - Get live data for specific gameweek

## Caching Strategy
- **Update Frequency**: Once per gameweek or when deadline passes
- **Cache Duration**: 1-6 hours depending on gameweek status
- **Invalidation**: When `data_checked` changes from false to true
